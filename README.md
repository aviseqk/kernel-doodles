# ✍️ kernel-doodles

## Intro  
This repo contains **8 mini–mini projects** designed as warmups for **Linux system call exploration**.  
Each project focuses on combining syscalls into small but realistic, usable tools.  
Think of them as *doodles in code* — quick sketches that helped me practice low-level programming.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  

These are **warmup/exploration projects**, not production-ready tools.  
They’re meant for **learning, experimentation, and fun** with Linux internals.
